# QueueBot
It is made to keep a track of the Queue in the Discord server by using Discord API.

Some commands are only used by the instructors like (!next and !empty).

For non instructors can only use limited commands like like (!join, !leave, !help)

The hosted server is on replit. Just change the token to your server token and enjoy.
